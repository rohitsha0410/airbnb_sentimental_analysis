The purpose of this project to analyze customer reviews for Airbnb for Bangkok. This acts as a stepping stone to know what the customers think of the service offered by Bangkoks's Airbnb, and this analysis could help to know if the hosts are providing good customer service or not.

The data has been analyzed, cleansed and aggregated where appropriate to faciliate public discussion. More on this data, and other similar data refers to this (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

The analysis progress would be separated on three notebooks.

1) The first notebook will cover the Data Processing Part which covers the data loading and cleaning part. 
2) The second notebook will cover the Text Processing Part which covers the text processing part. 
3) The third notebook will cover the Modeling part, where we will be doing sentimental analysis and making classification Machine Learing algorithms. We will then conclude with modeling the most accurate and high performing Deep Learning Modeling.
