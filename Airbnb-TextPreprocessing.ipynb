It is basically a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. VADER relies on a dictionary that maps lexical features to emotion intensities known as sentiment scores. The sentiment score of a text can be obtained by summing up the intensity of each word in the text."

       "'I honestly can\\'t thank Raewyn enough. Myself and my fiance were looking for a quiet place to relax after the hectic Bangkok life. Raewyn\\'s property is an oasis. Tucked away from the real world. My fiance loved it and didn\\'t want to do anything but stay in our cabin or lie by the pool. It\\'s very surprising they aren\\'t overrun. My fiance was recovering for three days and Raewyn assured she was ok while I was away and when I had to fly out early. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The property is a bit hard to find but Raewyn picked us up from the metro station. Once you figure it out you\\'ll have no problem. Took me about 30 minutes to get down to central Bangkok on the train system. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We were there during Songkran so it was a bit noisy outside the property as it\\'s a five minute walk to the local temple. This didn\\'t bother us much as it was over by 10. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>When it\\'s said that this place is off the beaten path, it\\'s the truth. If you\\'re looking for a party don\\'t stay here. It\\'s not that kind of place nor is it close to one. This place is for families and couples as well as single travelers looking for an escape. A place you can actually hear yourself think. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The cabin was great. The ONLY improvement I would like to see is an upgrade to the TV set for the rainy days you want to stay in and watch the many dvds they provide you. Outside of that nothing. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We have to thank them for taking care of us like family. Quick story. After a long day of travel I walked into the complex to find Raewyn and here family socializing and eating. I was greeted with a hearty \"welcome home\". I then proceeded to my room and 30 minutes later get a knock on the door. Raewyn with a plate of fresh mangoes they had picked from one of their trees. Little things like this are what you can expect. I don\\'t have the words or space to express my happiness and appreciation for this place and it\\'s wonderful owners. As a professional traveler I have stayed in every kind of place imaginable but I can\\'t think of one that surprised me more. STAY HERE if you want peace and service. Truly like being home. '"
